      `independently released emulators are wired together, documented as a family, ` +
      `and *tested against each other*.

` +
      "```sh\n" +
      `docker compose up            # entra + arm + keyvault
` +
      `docker compose --profile fabric up   # …adds fabric
` +
      `docker compose --profile apim up         # …adds apim
` +
      `docker compose --profile databricks up   # …adds databricks
` +
      "```\n" +
      `
ARM governs the vault, as it does in Azure: role assignments decide who may ` +
      `read a secret, and **no assignment means no access**.

` +
      `:::note
No single emulator's CI can verify the family. entra's tests prove entra issues ` +
      `correct tokens; ARM's prove ARM validates *some* issuer. Neither proves that ARM ` +
      `validates *entra's* tokens, nor that the six images boot together in the right ` +
      `order. That cross-cutting proof has to live somewhere neutral — here.

` +
      `## Start here

` +
      `- [Quickstart](01-quickstart.md) — the whole family in one command
